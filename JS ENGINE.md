1. **JS Runtime Environment**: Includes all components necessary for executing JavaScript code.
  
2. **Components**: Comprises a JS engine, a set of APIs, a callback queue, a microtask queue, and an event loop.

3. **JS Engine**: A crucial component that interprets and executes JavaScript code.

4. **Process Flow**: The execution process involves parsing, compilation, and execution.

5. **Parsing**: The code is broken into tokens, which are then converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

6. **JIT Compilation**: Modern JS engines utilize Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which interprets and optimizes code concurrently.

7. **Execution and Compilation**: These processes often occur simultaneously to enhance performance.

8. **Execution Features**: Includes a garbage collector and optimizations like inlining, copy elision, and inline caching to improve execution efficiency.

This encapsulates the key aspects of how JavaScript runs within its environment!

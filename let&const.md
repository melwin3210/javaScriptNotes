### Key Points about `let` and `const` in JavaScript

1. **Hoisting Behavior:**
   - `let` and `const` are hoisted, but their memory is allocated in a way that you can’t access them before they are initialized.

2. **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):**
   - There’s a period called the **Temporal Dead Zone** where you cannot use a `let` or `const` variable until it’s declared and assigned a value.

3. **Global Access:**
   - You cannot access `let` or `const` variables from the global object (`window` or `this`).

4. **No Redeclaration:**
   - You cannot redeclare the same variable using `let` or `const`. Even `var` cannot be used to redeclare a variable that has already been declared with `let` or `const`.

5. **Const Initialization:**
   - When using `const`, you must declare and initialize the variable on the same line.

6. **Types of Errors:**
   - **ReferenceError:** Happens when you try to access a variable that hasn’t been declared. (eg: console.log(a); let a = 10;)
   - **TypeError:** Occurs when you try to change a value to a type that isn’t allowed. (eg: const a = 100; a = 23;)
   - **SyntaxError:** Arises from using incorrect syntax in your code. (eg: const a;)

7. **Best Practices:**
   - Use `const` whenever possible, followed by `let`, and use `var` sparingly. This helps prevent errors.

8. **Initialization:**
   - Initializing variables at the top of your code can help avoid the Temporal Dead Zone and make your code cleaner.

### Summary
`let` and `const` have specific rules in JavaScript that help manage variable scope and prevent errors. Understanding these rules helps you write better, more reliable code.

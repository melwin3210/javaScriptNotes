JavaScript is considered a **dynamically-typed** language because the type of a variable is determined at **runtime**, not at **compile-time**. In other words, you don’t need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it, and the type of a variable can change during the program’s execution.

Here are the key reasons why JavaScript is dynamically typed:

### 1. **No Type Declarations**
In JavaScript, you don’t have to explicitly declare the type of a variable. For example:

```javascript
let myVar = 42;      // myVar is a number
myVar = "Hello";     // now myVar is a string
myVar = true;        // now myVar is a boolean
```

In the example above, `myVar` changes type from a number to a string to a boolean during runtime without any type annotations.

### 2. **Types Are Determined at Runtime**
The JavaScript engine determines the type of a variable based on its value when the program is executed, not before. This means the type can change dynamically during the execution of the program. You can assign any value of any type to a variable at any point in time.

### 3. **No Type Checking at Compile-Time**
Unlike statically-typed languages like Java or C#, JavaScript does not require you to declare the types of variables. Since there’s no compile-time type checking, the language relies on runtime checks to identify types.

### 4. **Type Coercion**
JavaScript allows **implicit type conversion** (also known as **type coercion**), meaning it can automatically convert one type to another when necessary. For example:

```javascript
let x = "5" + 1;  // x becomes "51" (string), not 6
let y = "5" - 1;  // y becomes 4 (number), JavaScript coerces the string to a number
```

This behavior is possible because JavaScript determines types at runtime and may perform implicit conversions as it sees fit.

### 5. **Flexible Operations on Variables**
Since the type of a variable is determined dynamically, you can perform operations with variables of different types without explicit type conversion. For example:

```javascript
let result = "Hello" + 42; // result becomes "Hello42" (a string)
```

JavaScript automatically converts the number `42` to a string and concatenates them.

### 6. **Objects and Arrays**
In JavaScript, arrays and objects are also dynamically typed. You don’t need to specify their structure in advance, and you can add or remove properties or elements at runtime. For instance:

```javascript
let person = {};    // An empty object
person.name = "John";  // Adding a property dynamically
person.age = 30;      // Adding another property
```

Similarly, in arrays:

```javascript
let arr = [];        // An empty array
arr.push(42);        // Adding a number
arr.push("hello");   // Adding a string
```

### Conclusion
JavaScript’s dynamic typing provides flexibility and allows rapid development, but it also introduces potential for runtime errors (e.g., trying to perform operations on incompatible types). However, many developers appreciate this flexibility, as it simplifies writing and testing code without having to worry about type constraints.

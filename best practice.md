1. **DRY Principle**: Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication and improve maintainability.

2. **Use of Functions**: Utilize functions to encapsulate repetitive code, promoting reusability and clarity.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**: A function that takes another function as an argument (often referred to as a callback function) is known as a higher-order function. This allows for greater flexibility in handling operations.

4. **First-Class Citizens**: Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This capability enhances the expressiveness of the language.

5. **Array Methods**: When you use `Array.prototype.functionName`, that function becomes accessible to any array in your code, allowing for consistent operations across all array instances.

This encapsulates the principles of writing clean, reusable code and the significance of functions in JavaScript!

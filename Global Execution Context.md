### Understanding the Global Context in JavaScript

1. **Global Execution Context:**
   - When a JavaScript program runs in a browser, a global execution context is created. This context is represented by the **window object**.

2. **The `this` Keyword:**
   - In the global context, the `this` keyword refers to the global object (the window object in browsers).

3. **Global Space:**
   - Any variable or function defined outside of any function is in the "global space."

4. **Attaching to the Global Object:**
   - Variables and functions created in the global space automatically become properties of the global object (window).

5. **Accessing Global Variables and Functions:**
   - You can access global variables and functions in several ways:
     - `console.log(window.a);`  // Accessing via the window object
     - `console.log(a);`         // Direct access (no need for window)
     - `console.log(this.a);`    // Using `this`, which points to the window in global scope

### Summary
In the global context of a browser, everything you define (variables/functions) is attached to the window object, and you can access them using `window`, `this`, or directly by their name.
